    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      <em>The Never Ending Degen Dream</em> is a 666-supply NFT collection created by
      <strong>Boplord (Jim Björklund)</strong>, a Stockholm-based artist and music producer. 
      Born during the 2021-2022 Web3 wave, the project was a creative response to the hype-driven, 
      copy-paste culture of early NFT drops — designed instead as an authentic experiment in community, 
      humor, and self-expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built live over eight days within the Mutant Shiba Club community, the collection helped fund 
      Boplord's music production studies while establishing his footprint as a multidisciplinary creative. 
      The project deliberately avoided a strict roadmap, embracing the chaos and spontaneity of degen culture 
      under the guiding motto: <strong>“The Never Ending Degen Dream.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Early concepts included a platformer game called <em>Bopiverse</em>, an in-house merch line with 
      embroidered apparel, and musical integration through releases under <em>Boplord</em> and 
      <em>Bopgang3000</em>. While those features were never fully realized, the project achieved its 
      true aim — to stand as a statement of creative independence in a speculative era of Web3.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it made you laugh, think, or feel something genuine, then it served its purpose.  
      <br>— <strong>Boplord</strong>
